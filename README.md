### Why do we need this [AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet library](https://github.com/khoih-prog/AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet)

#### Features

This [AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet library](https://github.com/khoih-prog/AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet) is a fully **asynchronous UDP library**, designed for a trouble-free, multi-connection network environment, for `ESP32` boards using `LwIP` W5500, W6100 or ENC28J60 Ethernet. The library is easy to use and includes support for `Unicast`, `Broadcast` and `Multicast` environments.

This library is based on, modified from:

1. [Hristo Gochkov's AsyncUDP](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/AsyncUDP)

to apply the better and faster **asynchronous** feature of the **powerful** [AsyncUDP](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/AsyncUDP) into `ESP32` boards using `LwIP` W5500, W6100 or ENC28J60 Ethernet.


#### Why Async is better

- Using asynchronous network means that you can handle **more than one connection at the same time**
- You are called once the request is ready and parsed
- When you send the response, you are **immediately ready** to handle other connections while the server is taking care of sending the response in the background
- **Speed is OMG**
- After connecting to a UDP server as an Async Client, you are **immediately ready** to handle other connections while the Client is taking care of receiving the UDP responding packets in the background.
- You are not required to check in a tight loop() the arrival of the UDP responding packets to process them.


#### Currently supported Boards

1. **ESP32-based boards using `LwIP` W5500, W6100 or ENC28J60 Ethernet

### Installation

The suggested way to install is to:

#### Use Arduino Library Manager

The best way is to use `Arduino Library Manager`. Search for `AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet`, then select / install the latest version. You can also use this link [![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet.svg?)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet) for more detailed instructions.

### Manual Install

1. Navigate to [AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet](https://github.com/khoih-prog/AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet) page.
2. Download the latest release `AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet-main.zip`.
3. Extract the zip file to `AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet-main` directory 
4. Copy the whole `AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet-main` folder to Arduino libraries' directory such as `~/Arduino/libraries/`.

### VS Code & PlatformIO:

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide)
3. Install [**AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet** library](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet) by using [Library Manager](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet/installation). Search for AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet in [Platform.io Author's Libraries](https://platformio.org/lib/search?query=author:%22Khoi%20Hoang%22)
4. Use included [platformio.ini](platformio/platformio.ini) file from examples to ensure that all dependent libraries will installed automatically. Please visit documentation for the other options and examples at [Project Configuration File](https://docs.platformio.org/page/projectconf.html)

---
---


### Libraries' Patches

#### 1. For fixing ESP32 compile error

To fix [`ESP32 compile error`](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32), just copy the following file into the [`ESP32`](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) cores/esp32 directory (e.g. ./arduino-1.8.19/hardware/espressif/cores/esp32) to overwrite the old file:
- [Server.h](LibraryPatches/esp32/cores/esp32/Server.h)


---
---


### HOWTO Fix `Multiple Definitions` Linker Error

The current library implementation, using `xyz-Impl.h` instead of standard `xyz.cpp`, possibly creates certain `Multiple Definitions` Linker error in certain use cases.

You can include this `.hpp` file

```cpp
// Can be included as many times as necessary, without `Multiple Definitions` Linker Error
#include "AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet.hpp"     //https://github.com/khoih-prog/AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet
```

in many files. But be sure to use the following `.h` file **in just 1 `.h`, `.cpp` or `.ino` file**, which must **not be included in any other file**, to avoid `Multiple Definitions` Linker Error

```cpp
// To be included only in main(), .ino with setup() to avoid `Multiple Definitions` Linker Error
#include "AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet.h"       //https://github.com/khoih-prog/AsyncUDP_ESP32_Ethernet
```

Check the new [**multiFileProject** example](examples/multiFileProject) for a `HOWTO` demo.

### HOWTO Use analogRead() with ESP32 running WiFi and/or BlueTooth (BT/BLE)

Please have a look at [**ESP_WiFiManager Issue 39: Not able to read analog port when using the autoconnect example**](https://github.com/khoih-prog/ESP_WiFiManager/issues/39) to have more detailed description and solution of the issue.

#### 1.  ESP32 has 2 ADCs, named ADC1 and ADC2

#### 2. ESP32 ADCs functions

- `ADC1` controls `ADC` function for pins **GPIO32-GPIO39**
- `ADC2` controls `ADC` function for pins **GPIO0, 2, 4, 12-15, 25-27**

#### 3.. ESP32 WiFi uses ADC2 for WiFi functions

Look in file [**adc_common.c**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/components/driver/adc_common.c#L61)

> In ADC2, there're two locks used for different cases:
> 1. lock shared with app and Wi-Fi:
>    ESP32:
>         When Wi-Fi using the ADC2, we assume it will never stop, so app checks the lock and returns immediately if failed.
>    ESP32S2:
>         The controller's control over the ADC is determined by the arbiter. There is no need to control by lock.
> 
> 2. lock shared between tasks:
>    when several tasks sharing the ADC2, we want to guarantee
>    all the requests will be handled.
>    Since conversions are short (about 31us), app returns the lock very soon,
>    we use a spinlock to stand there waiting to do conversions one by one.
> 
> adc2_spinlock should be acquired first, then adc2_wifi_lock or rtc_spinlock.


- In order to use `ADC2` for other functions, we have to **acquire complicated firmware locks and very difficult to do**
- So, it's not advisable to use `ADC2` with WiFi/BlueTooth (BT/BLE).
- Use `ADC1`, and pins **GPIO32-GPIO39**
- If somehow it's a must to use those pins serviced by `ADC2` (**GPIO0, 2, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 25, 26 and 27**), use the **fix mentioned at the end** of [**ESP_WiFiManager Issue 39: Not able to read analog port when using the autoconnect example**](https://github.com/khoih-prog/ESP_WiFiManager/issues/39) to work with ESP32 WiFi/BlueTooth (BT/BLE).

### How to connect W5500, W6100 or ENC28J60 to ESP32

You can change the `INT` pin to another one. Default is `GPIO4`

```cpp
// Must connect INT to GPIOxx or not working
#define INT_GPIO            4
```

### Debug

Debug is enabled by default on Serial. To disable, use level 0

```cpp
#define ASYNC_UDP_ESP32_ETHERNET_DEBUG_PORT      Serial

// Use from 0 to 4. Higher number, more debugging messages and memory usage.
#define _ASYNC_UDP_ESP32_ETHERNET_LOGLEVEL_      1
```

You can also change the debugging level from 0 to 4

```cpp
#define ASYNC_UDP_ESP32_ETHERNET_DEBUG_PORT      Serial

// Use from 0 to 4. Higher number, more debugging messages and memory usage.
#define _ASYNC_UDP_ESP32_ETHERNET_LOGLEVEL_      4
```

---
---

### Troubleshooting

If you get compilation errors, more often than not, you may need to install a newer version of Arduino IDE, the Arduino `ESP32` core or depending libraries.

Sometimes, the library will only work if you update the `ESP32` core to the latest version because I am always using the latest cores /libraries.
